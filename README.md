# Invitation Link Verification

A simple HTML-based project to practice creating a confirmation link for an invitation page.

## 📂 Project Structure
#### invitation-link 
#### ├── accept.html 
#### └── index.html


## 🎯 Goal
Create a clickable link in `index.html` that:
- Opens `accept.html` in a **new browser tab**.
- Has any link text you choose.
- Does **not** modify `accept.html` (only `index.html` can be changed).

## 🛠 Instructions
1. Open the `index.html` file.
2. Insert an HTML `<a>` tag that links to `accept.html`.
3. Set the link to open in a new tab using the `target="_blank"` attribute.
4. Style or text of the link is up to you.

## 📌 Notes
- `accept.html` already contains details for the confirmation page.
- No external libraries or frameworks are required.

## 🏁 How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in your browser to test.
